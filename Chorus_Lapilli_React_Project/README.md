This React app is a tweaked version of the ancient Roman game, terni lapilli, called chorus lapilli. 

The rules are as follow: 

Chorus lapilli is like tic-tac-toe in that players take turn placing pieces on a 3×3 board and the goal is to get three 
pieces in a row. However, it differs from tic-tac-toe in two ways:

  - After your first three moves, instead of adding further pieces you must instead move one of your existing pieces 
	to an adjacent empty square. Therefore, after your third move you always occupy three squares. The move can be up, 
	down, left, right, or diagonal.
	- If it is your turn to move and you have three pieces on the board and one of your pieces is in the center square, 
	your move must either win or vacate the center square.


Note: All of the actual code that I wrote for this is found in the App.jsx file, but to run the app you need to copy 
this entire directory then run: npm run dev, and copy/paste the host url into your browser.
